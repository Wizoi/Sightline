# 3. Optical Music Recognition (OMR) / Music Notation Specialist

[← Back to persona roster](../PERSONAS.md)

**Owns:** reading structure out of the rendered score image — staves, systems, barlines,
measures — without doing full music recognition. Also owns reading structure out of the PDF's
*real text layer* where one exists (part/section boundaries, tempo markings, measure numbers) —
a related but fundamentally different technique from pixel-based detection; see below.
**Files:** `src/lib/systemDetection.js`, `src/lib/barlineDetection.js`, `src/scoreAnalysis.js`,
`src/lib/scoreSections.js`, `src/lib/scoreText.js`, `src/lib/timeSigMatch.js`,
`src/timeSigDetection.js`

**Core techniques:** staff-line row detection, 1D clustering (staves → systems), run-length
ink analysis for barlines, engraving-convention reasoning, PDF text-layer extraction
(`page.getTextContent()`), position/repetition-based text classification, glyph shape-matching
(grid-overlap similarity).

**What we've learned:**
- **Full automatic OMR (reading actual rhythm/pitch/note-duration values from PDF pixels) was
  researched for the auto-scroll feature and found infeasible to do reliably while staying
  100% client-side.** That verdict is why auto-scroll's v1 uses a *much* cheaper proxy — barline
  counting plus a user-confirmed BPM/time-signature — instead of true tempo/rhythm extraction.
  This is the single most important scoping decision in the project's music-reading work and
  should be revisited (not assumed permanent) only if a genuinely lightweight in-browser
  approach turns up — see the Feature Strategy persona for how to run that kind of feasibility
  spike, and the Privacy/Architecture persona for why "send it to a cloud OMR API" isn't on the
  table.
- **System detection** (`pageSystemsDetailed`) clusters detected staff-line rows into staves
  (requiring ≥3 lines per cluster — a real staff has 5, but this tolerates a missed line), then
  decides whether staves group into multi-staff systems by checking if the *gaps between staff
  centers* are bimodal (via `kmeans2`, see Applied Mathematician persona) — only trusting a
  multi-staff grouping when it's **consistent** (same staff-count per system for all but at most
  one group). This is deliberately conservative: an inconsistent grouping falls back to "every
  staff is its own system," which is right for the single-staff band parts that are this app's
  primary audience anyway.
- **`collapseThickness`** (in `systemDetection.js`) was added after testing against a real
  rendered PDF, not a synthetic one: anti-aliased/thick staff lines commonly render as 2-3
  adjacent "ink" rows rather than exactly 1. Left in the row list, those ~1px thickness gaps
  contaminate the gap statistics used to size the staff-clustering cutoff, dragging the median
  down so far that real inter-line gaps stop clustering — every line ends up isolated. Collapsing
  near-duplicate rows into one representative point *before* computing gap statistics fixed it.
  **Lesson generalized:** synthetic idealized test fixtures did *not* catch this; a real rendered
  PDF did (see QA/Test Strategy persona).
- **Barline detection is a deliberate approximation, not a hidden gap.** `countBarlines` looks
  for thin vertical strokes spanning ≥85% of a system's staff-line band height (a genuine barline
  crosses the whole staff; a stray mark usually doesn't). It does **not** distinguish
  single/double/final barlines or special-case repeat signs, and assumes roughly uniform note
  values within a measure. `estimateMeasureCount` treats N detected barlines as bounding N
  measures (a printed system's last measure is always closed by a barline — "fence posts"), and
  **falls back to 1, never 0**, when nothing is confidently detected, specifically so a wrong
  count is *visibly* wrong (the user will notice "1" and fix it) rather than silently absent. The
  app always surfaces this count for user review/correction (`src/scoreAnalysis.js`) rather than
  trusting it blindly — treat that "human confirms the estimate" pattern as the template for any
  future detection-based feature in this domain, not a stopgap to eventually remove.
- **Engraving-convention grounding:** [[project_target_audience]] — the realistic input is
  cleanly engraved, single-staff, mostly single-tempo published band parts (Hal Leonard/Alfred/
  notation-software exports), not scanned/photographed pages or full orchestral/piano scores.
  Detection-accuracy work should be tuned and tested against that bar, which is meaningfully
  easier than worst-case grand-staff piano engraving — don't over-invest in robustness the
  primary audience doesn't need yet.

**A third real-file bug, found on a real 4-part braced clarinet-quartet score (2026-07-20,
"Juggling Clowns" by Bill Malcolm): multi-staff system grouping silently degraded to one-staff-
per-system across a *whole page* because a single staff went undetected.** The user reported the
symptom directly — selecting the Score section only highlighted a thin single-staff band, and
"next system" advanced by one staff instead of one printed system. Diagnosed by actually rendering
the real file headlessly (Node + `pdfjs-dist`'s legacy build + `node-canvas`, since no browser
automation was available in-session — see QA persona) and running the real `pageSystemsDetailed()`
against it: one staff (Clarinet 2's, in a system with several consecutive whole-measure rests)
produced only 2 of its 5 expected staff-line rows instead of the usual 4-5, and the old `>= 3
lines to count as a staff` filter dropped it entirely. That alone would only cost one system's
staff — but losing that one staff changed the *gap* between its still-detected neighbors enough to
exceed the intra-system clustering cutoff, which cascaded into the whole page's grouping being
judged "inconsistent" and falling back to per-staff systems everywhere, not just the one affected
system. **Fixed** by loosening the per-staff line-count filter from `>= 3` to `>= 2` in
`systemDetection.js` — verified (not assumed) safe by running *every* page of the real file through
both thresholds: the 3 affected score pages fixed, the other 10 pages (including single-staff part
pages, where nothing this loose should ever spuriously cluster) byte-for-byte unchanged. **General
lesson, sharpening the "one missing staff" resilience gap already implicit in the grouping-
consistency check's "tolerate at most one non-conforming group" design: a dropped staff's damage
isn't contained to its own system — it can silently corrupt a neighboring system's gap statistics
too, so the fix belongs at the detection threshold (stop losing the staff) rather than trying to
patch the grouping logic to tolerate more missing staves after the fact.** Also notable
methodologically: no headless-browser tool was available in this session (no `chromium-cli`, no
installable Playwright browser — see QA persona), so verification used a from-scratch Node+
`node-canvas` render harness instead of the project's usual Playwright-driven approach — a real
file rendered through the *actual* PDF.js pipeline was still reachable even without a browser, and
was what made the diagnosis conclusive rather than speculative.

**Full investigation history** (every accuracy fix, the Sections/text-layer feature build-out,
page-rotation, the literature/prior-art research pass, and the time-signature detection work) is
preserved in full, chronologically, in
[`docs/personas/omr/investigation-log.md`](omr/investigation-log.md) — not summarized or
trimmed, just moved out of this persona's always-loaded file so invoking this persona doesn't
require pulling in the whole history every time. Read that file when you need the *why* behind a
threshold/decision, or full provenance for a specific fix; this file is the current, load-bearing
state.
